<h2>The best movies according to this guy! </h2>

<hr>

<h3>Hulk</h3>
<p>The green beast created by the white man that can only be controlled by him(White scientist).<br >
"Only a white man that's smart can tame the beast", so they say.
</p>

<h3>Lion King</h3>
<p>An adopted lion becomes king in a different kingdom.<br > 
    The righful heir was mad to look senile and incapable of ruling his birthright kingdom.
</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>The shapeshifting white man can turn into a nephilim, and be accepted into society.<br >
is it truth hidden in plain sight?<br >
Or is it just a harmless kids story.<br >
I guess we'll never know Disney.
